<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
If you have a bunch of sites with the same or similar Google Tag Manager setup, and your daily job is to keep all containers in consistent state - make all needed changes only in one container, tests everything and then use ‚öôÔ∏è gtm-gear to sync changes between containers.

Or if you have base set up for GA/GAds/DV360/Facebook/... you can once save it and then push to new client's GTM container with a few lines of code üí™.

_Project is still in work the current version is 0.1_

 **Main scenarios üî•:** 
- Get tags, triggers, variables, built in variables, folders by API;
- Cache all data to reduce amount of requests;
- Limit request rate to 25 by 100 seconds as its default limit for GTM API;
- Update params you need;
- Set tags on pause;
- Create new workspaces;
- Copy tags between containers;
- Copy everything in version to other container;
- Check the difference between containers;
- Clean container: delete tags on pause, delete not used variables and triggers.
